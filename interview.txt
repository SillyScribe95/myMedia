no the hospitality industry is warned that any move to continue social distancing for a prolonged period would be catastrophic for restaurants bars and hotels it comes as both Scottish and you Kiev government officials have suggested the practice could last into next year the sector has been one of those hardest hit joining us now to discuss what it could mean our Willie McLeod from the industry body Yuuki hospitality and David McGuire who owns the 1051 gwr restaurant in Glasgow they've been providing meals to key workers and vulnerable people during the lockdown hello both good morning first of all David let's just look at what you have been doing just talk us through the effort to feed Valle knurl people and key workers it became obvious very at the very start of this around about 22nd 20th of March that there was a huge explosion of goodwill locally in in the West End applies where people wanted to be able to take this to the neighbors to the boats to walk so we started producing hot meals in bulk the people could come and just pick them up didn't have to pay for and they could take Murray to anybody elderly vulnerable who's even aware of in the neighborhood we've responded out a bit now where were assisting the people who work in nearly chairs had gotten able and we've got about 360 news going on today to me 11 different charities who you know Standing Orders in total we probably give away about shows and music and how is the goodwill going because obviously you know when it was all new and fresh you could see that there was a real explosion of it but is it still all there yes I would say that it is yet people are still determined to try and volunteer try and do the bit sometimes it's almost a kind of excess of volunteering and all that sounds ridiculous but we would love to find activity for people to do sometimes we just can't think of things those so but people should keep volunteering having said that you are a business how are you funding all of this we have set up a GoFundMe page and we've been overwhelmed with the amount of money that we've raised we get through about two thousand pounds a day based on raw materials packaging and will be raised 40,000 pounds of that allowed us to treat for the first 20 days and will be bitten ourselves at the start of that and so long as we continue to get denise's either of cash of raw materials we will just keep doing it as long as we possibly can so you will end up possibly out-of-pocket but it's worth it yes I mean I think I heard you heard I have James McAvoy being into being interviewed about an enormous donation he made and he just thought these soldiers from last equation said you can't take it with you and I thought yeah fair enough that's a great explanation nothing further requires to be said that really do you in a moment really how much of this sort of thing is going on across the industry yeah I think first of all congratulations to David for exhibiting I think the best traditions of the hospitality industry which is being replicated right through the country right through the UK from hotels providing very often at a significant discount accommodation to key workers from those who work in the transport sector we we worked very closely at one stage with a Scottish Fire and Rescue Service who needed accommodation in different parts of the country for people who are moving around we've been helping find accommodation for offshore workers going offshore coming back onshore restaurants have been providing meals for NHS workers so there's been an amazing spirit of you know helping and trying to make a contribution as best we can and you know this is amazing coming from an industry that was so badly hit when the coronavirus crisis first hit if I go back to the last couple of weeks and February there wasn't a crisis by the time we'd reached the end of February the beginning of the March there was an absolute catastrophe facing us and and that catastrophe continues to face us depending on how long the crisis and when our businesses can get back to work well exactly know we are told that we will face a prolonged period of some kind of social distancing lockdown very hard to see how things like bars can reopen in these circumstances it's almost impossible to conceive how a bar with capacity of even a few hundred people or even smaller can actually operate and and keep its customers safe that just not designed to provide for social distancing and and more importantly I suspect if if we do put a limit on capacity and we use floor space more generously businesses are going to be trading sub-optimally and and it's going to take a long time for them to get back to to viability there is there is a reasonably generous package of support from the UK and the Scottish Government's which the industry appreciates greatly but I'm afraid more needs to be done if we want to sustain our hospitality and license sector that's so vital to the social life of our communities it's so vital to our high streets what about restaurants and hotels do you see them able to open anytime soon for key workers they they're generally providing a food direct to the room rather than having the bar and the restaurant open so really according to government diktat hotel bars and restaurants have to be shut at the moment and I can't see them reopening certainly not the general public anytime soon although it may be easier for hotels to accommodate people they might be well they probably can manage social distancing better than a restaurant or a restaurant or a bar where the customers are coming in off the street it should be possible to check people in and separate the rooms and feed them in their rooms but it will be a long time I think before anything gets back to what might become the new normal so David yours is a restaurant but it does have a bar area too doesn't it you know how do you see all of this working in the future well first of all let me say I think we'll these comments are absolutely on spot-on Willy is completely expert and has been for many years and in the field that he operates in in hotels etc and he's definitely his advice should be listened to carefully it was the case that we went from you know nothing to a catastrophe in the space of days there was no way that anyone could have prepared for that nor indeed could have been expected to prepare for that he's perfectly correct and saying that it is difficult to imagine how social distancing will work within the ambience of a small bar or even a big bar or even a big restaurant we have we have had our building remain open with significant traffic going through it every day and on the basis of what we have observed it would be my considered view that restaurants and bars ought not to open until such times at as as it is entirely safe to do so they are not an appropriate environment to expect people to observe with diligence social distancing rules okay well thank you both very much for speaking to us that's David McGuire from the 1051 gwr restaurant and Willie McLeod from UK hospitality
